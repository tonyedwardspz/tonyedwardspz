# Speaking

I really enjoy speaking at meetups and conferences for digital folk. Talks are typically fast-paced, entertaining (hopefully), and generally a little different from the majority of sessions.

One of my current talks focuses on the HTML5 speechRecognitionAPI and how it helps me to write hip-hop lyrics. I'd love to find more opportunities to deliver it at conferences and meetups with an enforceable code of conduct in place.

[Get in touch](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/contact/) or check me out on [Paper Call](https://www.papercall.io/speakers/tonyedwardspz) if you'd like me to speak at your event.
