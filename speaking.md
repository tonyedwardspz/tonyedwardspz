I really enjoy speaking at meetups and conferences for digital folk as well as hosting workshops. 

Meetup talks are typically fast-paced, entertaining (hopefully), and generally a little different from the majority of sessions.

A current favorite talk to deliver is MIDI Birds, another adventure in web browser wonderland. Starting with the 400 item bird song data set recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic, I take the audience on a multimedia journey that includes a history of MIDI, two interactive demos, a body-mounted target, and a rainbow wig.

[Get in touch](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/contact/) if you'd like me to speak at your event.
