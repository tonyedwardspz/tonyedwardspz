Today I released South West Communities into the wild. It's an aggregator of developer community events that I attend in the South West.

It's a rebuild of my final year project at Plymouth University, which was a technical exercise in progressive web apps, and a lesson in the benefits even a simple web framework brings. This time around, it's a static website that builds its dataset once each day. 

It requires no submission on the event organisers behalf for events to be included, which is always a blocker when trying to establish community focused online calendars.
