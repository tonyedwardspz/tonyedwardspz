I've stopped off in the capital to do some washing as part of business bumble through the UK and Europe. Instead of sitting in front of the washer and watching it spin, which is always fun, I headed to the British Museum to tick an item on the bucket list.

The [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) is an artifact that I've read about a bunch. It's one of the core artifacts that helped the modern world to understand the ancient one. In particular, the translation of heirogliphics into modern text was made possible thanks to having the carved decree in two other languages. Really happy to tick this one off the list as a history buff, and the rest of the exhibitions were equally impressive. . . although there was a lot to take in. Museums like this really help to bring the past to life.

With not enough time left to do anything before the wash was ready for collection, but more than I wanted to spend dawdling towards the laundrette, I decided to dispense some smiles as well as help stem the tide of a worldwide problem.

There are far too many selfies in the world. 

To address the imbalance, I spent some time wandering the halls, offering my services as an impromptu photographer. Any couple spotted taking a selfie were offered the service. Everyone was really happy to have a photo taken. Everyone agreed there are too many selfies. Everyone left that moment with a smile on their faces.
