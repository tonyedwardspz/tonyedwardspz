### From Figma to .NET MAUI: Transform Your Designs into XAML Code in Seconds
**02:00 - 02:30 GMT**

**With:** [Héctor Uriel Pérez Rojas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hprez21/)

In this session, I will share my journey in developing a tool called Xamlify, which allows me to convert Figma designs into XAML code in .NET MAUI in just a few seconds, enabling me to reduce the time spent on creating graphical interfaces by 80% to 90%. I achieved this using Blazor, a lot of C# code, and Azure OpenAI.


### Accessibility as a concept
**10:30 - 11:00 GMT**

**With:** [Jemima Abu](https://twitter.com/Jemimaabu)

Knowing how to build accessible products is important but it's just as important to know why we build products to be accessible. Basic human decency aside, there's a plethora of reasons for building products that everyone can use. In this talk, we'll explore the concept of accessibility in order to better understand its necessity and the ramifications involved in building non accessible products. We'll also answer pressing questions like "How do I know if this thing I built is accessible?" and "Whose job is it to ensure accessibility?" (Spoiler: it's everyone's job)


### Community Toolkit Roundup

Join a lively discussion with maintainers of the Community Toolkits, the .NET Community Toolkit, the MAUI Community Toolkit, and the Windows Community Toolkit. Learn about these open-source projects which aim to provide useful and high-quality components, controls, and utilities for .NET developers.

## Day 4
Friday, 15th November


### Deep dive on native AOT (YouTube Premier)
**18:00 - 18:30 GMT**

**With:** Michal Strehovský

Native AOT has been part of .NET since .NET 7. With each release we're extending the areas where it can be used. From console apps in .NET 7, through ASP.NET web APIs in .NET 8, to MAUI in .NET 9. It is your best bet if you need your .NET app to start fast and use as little memory as possible. But how does native AOT actually work? Why does it start so fast? How can we fit an entire .NET runtime, the base class libraries, and your code in a 1 MB executable file? In this talk we'll peek into the internal workings of native AOT compilation and look at what it does at run time.
