Last night, the Digital Plymouth Meetup was taken over by students from the comp-sci discipline at Plymouth Uni! For many, it was their first foray into professional networking. . . something that strikes fear into the heart of people from all walks of life, let alone new entrants to the industry. Thankfully, the friendly community that has gathered around the group made them welcome to the world of meet-ups. 

And what a great way to kick off the 2024 series of meets. All of the talks were interesting, however the chip tune performance by [@_2xAA](https://x.com/_2xAA) in the Immersive dome was something special. ModV has been on my radar for a few years, and getting to experience it in a 360 degree setting was very cool.

As a lecturer, it was great to see so many students mingling with the community, and even better to see such a welcoming community in action. It's almost certain that you'll see them at a future event, so be sure to say hi next time.

Who knows. . . you might just meet your next team mate.
