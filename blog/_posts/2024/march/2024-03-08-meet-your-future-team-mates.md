Last night, the Digital Plymouth Meetup was taken over by students from muliple years  comp-sci discipline at Plymouth Uni! Thankfully, Real Ideas' Market Hall was well equiped to cope with the new faces, and the friendly community that has gathered around the meetup made them feel welcome in the world of work eventing.

For many, it was their first foray into professional networking. . . something that strikes fear into the heart of people from all walks of life, let alone new entrants to the industry. 

And what a great way to kick off the 2024 series of this digi friendly meets. All of the talks were interesting, as you'd expect. Hearing about the plans for an immersive week and a dome world tour showed that the investment in Devonport is paying off. The work the ocean conservation trust has been doing 

To top the evening off in style. the chip tune performance by [@_2xAA](https://x.com/_2xAA) in Europe's largest Immersive Dome was something a bit special. [ModV](https://github.com/vcync/modV) has been on my radar for a few years, and getting to experience it in a 360 degree setting was very cool. It left me wodering if I can squeeze it into the Midi Birds ready for next months CityJS event, but I fear time is too short.

As a lecturer, it was great to see so many students mingling with the community, and even better to see such a welcoming community in action. It's almost certain that you'll see some of these at a future event. Be sure to say hi next time, easpecially if you didn't this time.

Who knows. . . you might just meet your next team mate.
