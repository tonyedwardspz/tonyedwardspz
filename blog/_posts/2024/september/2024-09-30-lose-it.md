I don't wanna  
Lose it  
Holdin' by a thread, I  
Wish I could forget, but  
I don't wanna  
Lose it  
Scared of movin' backwards  
Stuck inside a pattern  
I don't wanna  
Lose it  

[360:]  
Never thought I would take off (Take off)  
Fly round, land in the same spot  
As I said, it's about time when I get to cloud nine  
But it only left me with brain fog (Yeah)  
I don't care what ya mates say (Nah)  
Everybody knows I'm a head case  
I don't need a doctor to tell me  
No x-ray can explain my chest pain  
I don't know what I believe anymore (More)  
Don't I know if I believe what I read anymore (More)  
Like the world's gone dark, everybody's got a gaslight  
Tryna help me see through it all, and I see through it all  
(Yeah) Waitin' for an apology  
Got a better chance of makin' it with the lottery  
Hate that I always wanna be on my own, now  
I'm seein' anonymity taken as animosity  
I understand if you wanna disown me  
The last few years, I am not a good homie  
There's a part of my shit that I gotta be ownin'  
How I wanna be alone but don't wanna be lonely  
Yeah, but I like to wonder  
What life'll be like when I'm tryin' structure  
Can I rise above, but guys, I love ya  
Even though I treat phone calls like a private number  
Know what I'm gettin' in my own thoughts  
Went and made a fuck up like an iPhone chord  
As I look in the mirror, couldn't be clearer now  
We ain't seein' another eye in life at all (At all)  
Lose it  
Puttin' in the work, they can notice improvement  
Listen to the words that I wrote in the music  
Careful now, 'cause

Yo, for years I was lost in a silent state  
With a head so loud in a violent rage  
Feelin' fated to go throw life away when  
Real life is the one thing I try escape  
Now I'm trapped with a lion who can't be tamed  
Back to square one now, gotta start again  
Instead of runnin' away, I try to embrace and face  
All the shit up in my life that was hard to take, I  
Parted ways with the party ways and I'm  
Partly weighed down by that part today  
Don't give a fuck about anything, it's hard to take  
When I'm feelin' so much in me that it's hard to say  
Yeah, paid for a vase and a nice bouquet  
I'ma place on a grave when it's Father's Day  
My mind's evil, it's even been grievin' for people  
And they ain't even pass away (Yeah)  
'Cause I know I'm gonna hate it when they will be  
Overthinkin' everything, it got me feelin' guilty  
Distance will be only ever buildin'  
Thinkin' everyone I meet is only here to milk me, yeah  
Thoughts so sharp it'll kill me  
Let myself go, now feelin' so filthy  
Pick myself up, I'm puttin' it together how  
I never been before but I knowin' what I will be here, yeah
