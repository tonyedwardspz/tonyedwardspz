Ever since the extreme (for the UK) heatwave happened a few years back, there's been a noticable dip in the number of insects spotted in the garden.

The trend was continuing this year. . . until the last month. In particular, we've noticed an anecdotal bump in butterfly numbers. The same goes for Bees. Certainly not as high in numbers as they were a few years back, but an increase none the less.

This doesn't seem to be the trend. This years [butterfly count recorded record lows](https://butterfly-conservation.org/news-and-blog/uk-butterfly-emergency-declared) at the time. The damp summer just wasn't suited to a wide range of insects. My hope is that others are noticing the same uptick, and we'll get a flush that sets next year's population up well.

What can you do?

Over the past 60 years, the UK has lost 97% of its species-rich wildflower meadows. It's these native wildflower meadows that many insects eat and nest in. Anything you do to add a [few native wildflowers](https://www.wildflower.co.uk/products/wildflower-seed-mixtures/butterfly-and-bee/) into you garden will help, no matter how small an area it is.

Just remememebr to leave them in-situ once they've finish flowering so that the critters can nest over winter.
