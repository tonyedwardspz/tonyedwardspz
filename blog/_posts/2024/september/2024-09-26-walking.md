[Verse 1]

Sometimes it's best to give up the fight  
All that really matters is I know that I'm right  
I can't be following anyone else's ideal path of success  
I pass up that stress, feel bad for the quest, gasping for breath  
Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death, passion is left  
Ashes to dust...  
Just to sit in the love of an antique box on my window sill  
My mask is my flesh, my dream is to grow wings  
And sing 'til freedom rings  
I got no rhythm but I'm eager to unplug my speaker  
And let my heart be my teacher  
It's hard to tell where all this comes from  
It's like my soul holds a song that eternity left undone  
But it'll never be finished, that's the point  
But I got to get going, thanks for the inspiration


[Hook x2]

I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself


[Bridge x2]

Sometimes the closer you get, the further away it gets  
I run towards the rainbow but when I get there it's gone  
So next time there's a rainbow Imma run away from it  
So when I turn around, I'll see it while it's strong


[Verse 2]

Here we go now, I don't care about my whereabouts  
I'll blare it out, I gotta go that's all I know  
I'll hit the road and find my soul, and they say  
"Listen to me, get a degree  
Look up and see what you can be, infinity"  
But everything ain't anything anyway  
I see your eyes and realize I need to cry  
That you and I it's hard to hide  
We're being lied so deep inside  
Thanks for your help but I won't find nothing better  
In a world this beautiful, I'll be walking forever


[Hook]

I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  


[Verse 3]

On this journey I don't expect nothing but the unexpectable  
The only thing I know for a fact is that I'll never know  
Too much about myself so Imma keep learning  
Cause I'm determined to find what keeps this fire burning  
Turning these pages just as slow as I can  
Reading every single word from the poet within  
I float with the wind and stay content wherever it carries me  
There was no beginning and there won't be an end  
I'm just a piece of the galaxy, a seed in the soil  
A stream of consciousness and to the seasons I'm loyal  
Don't take my movement personal, it's not that I don't dig you  
But I can't be on the beach of your sea when it boils  
And so I walk with the music cause to me that's all that's real  
Don't know where I'm going, don't have a plan  
I've been hearing instructions my whole life  
And I still think walking away from the rainbow will make you more of a man  


[Hook]

I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  
I'm walking  
Walking until I find myself  


Speaking of walking, as I walked onto the set  
The director was like, "What the fuck you doing!?"  
Glanced around and said, "My fault. I'm in the wrong movie."
