I gave the much touted [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) AI enhanced editor a whirl in recent days.

Anyone who isn't getting really good at describing software problems in natural language today, is going to loose out tomorrow.

Chances are that early impressions will get toned down over time as the limitations become apparent. But the results are clear. Software development is set for a huge shake up really soon.

Get good now.
