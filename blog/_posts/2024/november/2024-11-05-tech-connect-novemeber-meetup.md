Today saw the latest rendition of the Tech Connect meetup, hosted at the Atlantic Hotel in Newquay. The gathering saw people from a broad spectrum of Cornish companies share their wisdom, and absorb more from the speakers, all in front of the beautiful backdrop afforded by the North coast Cornish coastline. . . in mizzle mode.

The day started with a session from [Bhavna Raithatha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavna-raithatha-mindset-coach/), a self styled mindset ninja, that walked the audience through the core requirements for a healthy mindset in a workplace context. The session felt like a much longer one squeezed into a short slot, where many of the points would have benefitted from a little expansion. Regardless, the talk was valuable and brought a few points to the fore for further consideration.

One that chimed a chord was that both fear and failure often positives, provided you have the right life context and mindset.

It's always great to see a Marcus Aurelius quote in the wild, particularly one in English (long story). It always makes me ponder the value of the wisdom within Meditations, given we're still using it as a reference for a good life in our modern context.

The lightning talks went by a smidge too quickly. I could have grilled [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-jackson-11823616/) and [Al](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alcwyn-parker-a0a54980/) from the Buzz Interactive team for at least a further hour on all things Orchard Core CMS. . . and still plan to! Orchard Core CMS crossed my path as a possible tool for extending the MIDI Birds project. Getting detailed insights from people working daily with the tool is always invaluable, and this was no difference. Our short conversation made me think it's probably a little over-engineered for my use case, but a candidate for a potential future stretch goal. It's certainly a solid choice for a CMS based website. For now, I'm going to investigate [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as part of the MVP.

Continuing the lightening talks, Rachel Foster gave a good overview of the courses that the Agile Communications Agency have launched recently. Mark Lovejoy from Avanti shared the open source Space Codev collaboration platform with the room, something I want to learn a whole bunch more about. Robert Wiltshire shared an update on the great work that [Tech Cornwall](https://techcornwall.co.uk/youth-programmes/) are doing to support future entrants into the industry. The lightning talks wrapped up with Kirsty Mile-Musgrave urged the room to take-up the business support and signposting service that the Growth Hub can offer.

Although I didn't get to see the whole thing, the talk by [Christian Thomson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianthomson/) from Marwick Marketing was a crowd favorite. It offered a good overview of the potential changes arriving in the SEO world as a result of Gemini being injected into the search ecosystem. In the final stretch of networking time, this was the buzz of the room. Some people are hesitant of the change, which is understandable given the huge changes to results served via Google in recent months, whereas others are excited to be thinking ahead at this early stage. Regardless, everyone was energized by the possibilities.

As always, this rendition of Tech Connect was fun to be a part of. The blend of interesting talks, the snippets from a broader range of businesses, and conversations with the community offered insight into the current state of Cornwalls Tech ecosystem. . . with all signs pointing to thriving.

Great work team.
