Really diggin' [this song by Snak The Ripper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdR7RjdK7sE) at the moment:

**Verse 1**

If you want to be a leader gotta follow your heart
Don’t tell em every move you making leave em all in the dark

Life is joy and pain, learning to acknowledge the art
While trying to hold it all together as it’s falling apart

Yo you’ll never get ahead second guessing yourself
You gotta get back up no matter the direction you fell

Make the wrong decision you could end up dead or in jail
It’s up to you, the life you livin' could be heaven or hell

Everything good in this life comes from taking a chance
Pay close attention to the details of you making some plans

Your networking doesn’t work unless you’re shaking some hands
You gotta put in work, the only way to make an advance

Gotta, show progression if you raising your price
If the situation is awkward try breaking the ice

If you, planning to make a move, make it precise
If you feeling lost in this life, I hope you take my advice


**Hook**

Stop stressing over nothing
Try to control your mind
Then learn to trust the process
Do that and you’ll be fine
Stop stressing over nothing
Try to control your mind
Then learn to trust the process
Do that and you’ll be fine


**Verse 2**

Gotta Believe when others doubt, and work when others refuse
Stay when others quit, and you’ll win when others lose

How you think you gonna build without a proper set of tools
Gotta think outside the box sometimes you gotta bend the rules

Keep your confidence up don’t be afraid of the rejection
Gotta focus on the positive and stay in that direction

Don’t let outside sources try swaying your perception
They just looking for attention, they just craving the affection

It’s okay to be alone, stop running with the heard
Put your blood into your work, and put your love in every word

Pay close attention to the road and every memory conserved
Every thought is like a diamond that you dug out of the dirt

Sometimes you got to slow it down and take in the sights
Instead giving up on what’s left, try making it right, if you

Planning to make a move, make it precise
If you feeling lost in this life, I hope you take my advice
