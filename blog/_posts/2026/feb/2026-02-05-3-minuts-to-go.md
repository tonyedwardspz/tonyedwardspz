3 mins left and I was stuck in the toilet

It was broadcast time.

Eat a Banana. Drink some water. Go to the bathroom.

Gran always said to never miss an opportunity, and this wasn't the moment to defy such hefty wisdom.

Hearing the click of the door behind me, it didn't cross my mind that this is the high security HQ of Microsoft. Doors have locks. A few minutes later I soon realised the consequences of this lapse in concentration.

The call was made.

I was rescued.

Everything worked out in the end. But it wasn't the warm-up I'd imagined for my guest appearance on the [dotnet YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X03ksPKX6A).

I wouldn't worry about watching.

My appearance amounts to just babbling about chocolate salty balls.

They are tasty tho.
