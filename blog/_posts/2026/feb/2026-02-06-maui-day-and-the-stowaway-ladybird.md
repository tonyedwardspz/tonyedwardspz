7 Talks + 2 nights away + a stowaway ladybird = another successful MAUI Day!

With almost 100 attendees in the room, how could it not be?

The gaggle of .NET MAUI developers had descended from around the globe on central London for a day of cross-platform knowledge sharing. Not only did we learn a whole bunch, but we also got to meet and mingle with the faces behind the avatars that we chat with day in and out. 

Between Syncfusion providing the food, NewDay providing the venue, and the community providing the conversations, the room was in exceptionally high spirits.

Was it fun?

It sure was.

Did it run on time?

Hell no!

Will we do it again?

For sure!

Where?

Everywhere!

For as long as another group of speakers are willing to assemble to provide an excuse to get together, then we've got no excuse not to. Massive thanks to David, Stéphane, Mark, Matt, Shriram, and Clifford for giving the days conversations a focal point, plus allowing the conf to ✅ the 5 continents box.

Not sure how we'll reach six!

In a distributed sector, within a distributed world, opportunities to connect in person and deepen the rapport built on top of hundreds of online chats is important. Both to the individual and the whole. Communities thrive based on the value of conversations, and judging by the buzz in the room last week the hashtag#dotnetMAUI community has never been so alive.

Just like the ladybird.

She's part of the colony hibernating in the bedroom back home, although one of the family decided to come on the 580 mile round train trip.

Thankfully, Premier Inn rooms are hermetically sealed. . . meaning she could fly around the room in the evening without me having to worry about her escaping. Countryside bugs don't deserve city life, although I'm sure she has some stories to tell the others!

We both have to be fair.

Overall, it was another successful trip to the UK capital for the hashtag#MAUIDay crew.

But multiple attendees on the day gave me feedback that there should be more focus on performance amongst the sessions.

Hopefully we'll be able to arrange that for London 2027, and maybe even add a little performance to the panel 🤞
