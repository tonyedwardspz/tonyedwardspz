This year marks the 9th that with blog has existed in one form or another, as part of over 20 years of an online life.

For more than a month, I've been publishing daily to my own platform for the first time in all those years. It’s been fun. Rewarding. Challenging. Even a little cathartic.

I think I’ll keep doing it for a little longer.
