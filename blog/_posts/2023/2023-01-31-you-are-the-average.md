It’s commonly held wisdom that:

> “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” - *Jim Rohn*

Another way of phrasing the same sentiment is:

> “Show me your friends and I’ll show you your future.” - *Unknown*

And yet another way:

> “Through others we become ourselves.” - *Lev S. Vygotsky*

All of these are, in essence, true. In my humble opinion, the people you spend time with naturally average out to become the baseline of your personality (for lack of better wording). This was especially true given the era these quotes are from, when in person conversations were the norm, and telephones were a luxury item for many.

Does the sentiment still apply today?

Through work and friendships, I hang out with a lot of geeks. Many of these fellow geekies might not spend a significant amount in the presence of others. So how do they reach their average?

Inputs.

> “We are the average of of five biggest inputs” - *Tony Edwards”

Day to day, we all accept various input into our lives. It might be. . .

- The news
- The articles we read
- The Discord chats with friends
- The forums we spend time on
- The books we consume
- The YouTube videos we watch
- The people we hang out with
- The social media we consume

. . . to name but a few inputs in our modern geeky lives.

But have you ever stopped to consider what these things do to our individual averages?

Globally, Android users spend [24 hours a month](https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-stats-marketers/#:~:text=11.%20Users%20spend%20almost%2024%20hours%20each%20month%20on%20the%20YouTube%20mobile%20app) on YouTube. A whole day! Are the videos being watched educational and entertaining, or are they a time suck? Do they improve the average or detract from it?

Do you consume the news daily and then take the learned rhetoric and apply it to both social media and your social circle? Ultimately, this causes more of the same rhetoric to filter into other areas of inputs. How does this affect our average? Negatively, I’d wager.

By focusing ourselves on the things that truly matter, we have an opportunity to shape our average in a very active way.

“Keep your attention focused entirely on what is truly your own concern, and be clear that what belongs to others is their business and none of yours.” - Epictetus

When you’re considering how to spend your time today, take a moment to consider how the parts of the whole are affecting your average.
