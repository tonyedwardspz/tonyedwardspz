Today I attended the Imagination unleashed event after being pointed towards it by [Screen Cornwall](https://www.screencornwall.com/), hosted at the Hall for Cornwall. It promised to bring together the CreaTech industry in the county for a day of shared insights, splitting the day between schools in the morning and grown-ups in the afternoon. It was a huge success.

> CreaTech is a term broadly used to characterise the role of technology-driven innovation in the creative industries.

It was interesting to see the scope of the local industry. Ameca made an appearance along with The Market Hall, Krowji, TECgirls and everyones [favourite book sniffer](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/book-sniffing-club/), to name just a few. With so many cool projects, companies and initiatives coming together, seeing what originates from the partnerships between attendees and delegates will be interesting.

My favourite part of the day was seeing the Hall for Cornwall completely empty and moving freely around the building. The recent renovation has been a huge success, managing to retain the rustic charm whilst crafting a cutting-edge theatre.

The event felt like the start of something exciting. I'm not sure I can put my finger on precisely what, but the promise of this new discipline is vast, and Cornwall is ideally placed to ride the CreaTech wave.
