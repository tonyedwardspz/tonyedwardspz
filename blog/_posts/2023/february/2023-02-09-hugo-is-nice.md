I stood up a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website yesterday as part of the [mini project](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/setting-goals) for my university module.

SSGs are nothing new to me. I'm a big fan of Jekyll but it's not the flavour of the month in the developer world. It's not shiny or new enough to keep the developer communities interest, despite the [recent uptick in development](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). Whilst it a productive environment for me to work within, it's time to stretch my coding legs.

Hugo was super simple to get setup. Adding in a basic template with quick and simple, and the elements of Go that you're exposed to make sense and doesn't require a working knowledge of the language. Oh, and it's quick. Like really quick.

Overall, super impressed and looking forward to the next few weeks with my head in Hugo.
