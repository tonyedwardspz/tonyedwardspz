title: Feedback without the creator

Today I shared a video with my students for feedback. They tore it a new one!

It was clear the video had been made by someone who doesn't use the target platform. It was also clear they hadn't had feedback from the target audience yet.

The feedback was brutal but honest. Something they wouldn't have been comfortable with if the creator (or other stakeholders) had been present.

I think there is a few lessons in here:

- Know your platform. They're all different. What works for one won't necessarily work for others.
- Get feedback from your target audience, not a different generation in a different life situation.
- Anonymous feedback will be more honest.
