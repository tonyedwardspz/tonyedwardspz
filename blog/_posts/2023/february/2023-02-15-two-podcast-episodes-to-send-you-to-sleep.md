Tim Ferriss has a solid podcast. Like many of us, I've been through extended Ferriss binges in the past. Today, his podcast is one I tune into if a topic captures my interest. There have been a couple of such episodes recently.

Both are on the topic of sleep. Both are with the same guest.

The two-parter with Dr. Matthew Walker has been an intriguing dive into the depths of sleep. It's a surprisingly wide-ranging conversation for such a narrow topic, one with more than a few suggestions that I plan to try. They'll probably get another listen sometime soon.

Check them out:

- [Episode 2](https://tim.blog/2023/02/08/dr-matthew-walker/)

He's got [a book](https://amzn.to/3I5FuZJ). Unsurprisingly.
