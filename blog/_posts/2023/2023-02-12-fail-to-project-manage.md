My life has a lot of planning in it at the moment. Some for work. Some for the students I'm supporting. Some for personal projects.

Over planning it pointless in this context, but some planning (and the project management that comes with it) is always a good idea.

It's going to be interesting to see how the varying degrees of planning across the 28 projects will affect the various outcomes in a few month time.
