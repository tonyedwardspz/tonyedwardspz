This week, I've been helping Tech Cornwall to run their Mission to Mars work experience program, filling a gap due to illness.

It's been great fun!

After more than three years away from the program, it's been nice to peer into the past to take part in the highlight of that role. Working along side Rob, we iterated an existing offer from the org, turning it into an award winning work experience which an arm of the UK government said was one of the best in the industry.

But it was never me or Rob who did that.

It was the kids. 

It was their enthusiasm, excitement, and thirst for learning that spurred us on to make it bigger, better and more industry relevant with each outing. It's been nice to absorb some of that youthful vibrance again.
