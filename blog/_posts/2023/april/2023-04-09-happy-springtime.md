A four day break for the Easter weekend is underway in the UK. Everywhere you look, chocolate eggs, bunnies and chicks mark the occasion. Personally, I'm partial to a Cadbury caramel egg if you're buying.

With winter behind us and spring well underway, it's time to celebrate that the sun has risen in the sky to a more useful zenith angle for the coming months.

Have a great weekend.
