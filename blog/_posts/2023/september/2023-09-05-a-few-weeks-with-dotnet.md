To prepare for the next work adventure, I've been diving into the dotnet ecosystem. It's a completely different software paradigm to the web first, JAMStack vibes I've been diggin in recent years, but a pleasant one nonetheless. 

It's been a nice refresher of the C# language and the depth of the dotnet framework along with the benefits of an out-of-the-box developer experiences. Whilst these all formed a part of my unversity experience, I was drawn in by the gravitational charm of the JavaScript ecosystem and letting the browser do the hard work if at all possible. Frameworks were kept at arms length if at all possible, certainly ones as humungous as dotnet.

The last couple of weeks have been about becoming familiar with the programming language, the workflow, the documentation, the debugging tools, the error messages amongst a whole host of other things connected to the tech stack. Additionally, it's been a while since I've sat at a desk day in and day out. There's been some work on the setup of the room, everything within arms reach and the in-house entertainment.

With the prep work done, I'm just glad that I don't have to spend a day setting up the build pipeline rather than building things to go through that pipeline for a while. In a stockholm syndrome-esque way, it's amazing how used to that developer experience I'd become.
