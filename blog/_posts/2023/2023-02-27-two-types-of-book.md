Non fiction books with a general topic will apply to a large number of people and situations. They contain good insights for moving in a direction towards a goal, and often sets the scene and strategy. Once you've read one, you can make a start.

A general book in the sales world might be: "The basics of B2B sales."

Non fiction books with a focused topic goes deep into a narrow area and contains knowledge from a niche problem domain. Books on a focused topic often help to solve a specific problem, taking a step towards a goal by providing tactics. Once you've read one, you can go deeper.

A specific book in the sales world might be: "Generate decision maker attention though ABM."

A mix of both is wise, but try to understand the reason for reading. Are you looking for strategy or tactics?
