First principles are life's immutable truths. They are facts that have always been true, always will be true, and, therefore, must be true at any moment. Leveraging first principles is an essential key to success. They are the fundamental building blocks of reality that underlie everything in our lives, including our thoughts, behaviours, and experiences.

These principles are immutable truths. They are unchangeable and non-negotiable, and they provide a solid foundation upon which we can build our lives. By understanding and applying first principles to our personal existence, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

The following 18 principles apply to most people in a similar life situation to me, much like the laws of physics, logic, and mathematics apply to everything between an atom and a galaxy.

Do you have any personal first principles?
