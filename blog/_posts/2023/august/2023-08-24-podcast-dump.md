Podcast dump

In the 7 years since the last [couple of](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/12-podcasts-for-web-developers/) [podcast posts](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/11-more-podcasts-for-web-developers/), my listening tastes have vastly changed. At the time, most of the day was spent in front of a computer learning to become a software engineer with podcasts acting as a passive input that could be tuned into and out of.

Whilst podcasts are still a significant part of my daily listening habits, Audiobooks account for far more of the listening schedule. When podcasts are listened too, I tend to work through a handful of series at a time, a couple episodes a session as opposed to living at the whim of a feed (allthough there is a tightly controlled feed that is dipped into).

Below are two categories of podcasts that are being enjoyed regularly, some as a daily driver and some that are bingeworthy. . . plus a few special mentions.

## Daily drivers

[The Space](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/u7fui-15c6f6/The-Space-Podcast)
A twice daily meditation and mindfulness podcast, that are the perfect bookend to the day.

[The Slowdown](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/jtbjz-77418/The-Slowdown-Poetry--Reflection-Daily-Podcast)
A short dose of poetry every weekday, perfect for a pre-bedtime wind-down routine.

[Stoic Meditations](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/2v8p7-624b2/Stoic-Meditations-Podcast)
A short daily hit of stoic wisdom.

[Coffee Break German](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/mbgd6-3391c/Coffee-Break-German-Podcast)
Useful for a quick German top-up whilst doing the housework.

## Bingeworthy

[History of English](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/weh7s-2f283/The-History-of-English-Podcast)
A DEEP dive into the evolution of the English language. . . which is far more interesting than it sounds.

[In Our Time](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/6rvhs-35508/In-Our-Time-Podcast)
Regular panel discussions about a very wide range of topics.

[The History of Rome](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/27dz3-35b9a/The-History-of-Rome-Podcast)
From start to (effectivley) the end, here’s the complete history of the Roman Empire.

[The History of Philosophy (without any gaps)](https://hopwag.podbean.com/)
Philosophy from its humble origins through to todays philosophical minds.

[Revolutions](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/zu2pn-2f275/Revolutions-Podcast)
A walk through of the various major revolutions throughout history.

## Worthy mentions

[Revisionist history](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/zhnrr-41533/Revisionist-History-Podcast)
Malcom Gladwell looks back at some moments in history and tells the tale from a different perspective.

[Fall of Civilisations](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/c36je-82b67/Fall-of-Civilizations-Podcast)
Hands down, the best podcast on this list if you like history. I’d recommend watching the video versions of each show over [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FallofCivilizations).

[Hidden Brain](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/kca2m-3739c/Hidden-Brain-Podcast)
A regular show that dives into well researched psychology in a calm and well scripted show.
