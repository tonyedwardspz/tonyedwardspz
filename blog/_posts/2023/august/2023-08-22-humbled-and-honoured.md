. . . that I've managed to start a new professional position without shouting all about it on social media.

It will take a lot of hard work to deliver the product I promised, but I'm just the right side of out of my depth and feeling confident. With the help of the people actually involved in my work and my friends, who will discover more about it from me, I'm sure it'll work out.

I'd like to thank everyone on the periphery of my network who's bored the world with exciting news announcements on social for nudging me towards this happy equilibrium.

If you're near the centre of my network of awesome humans, I'm always glad to hear your news. . . regardless of the medium.
