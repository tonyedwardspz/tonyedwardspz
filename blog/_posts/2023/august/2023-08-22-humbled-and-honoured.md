. . . that I've managed to start a new professional position without shouting all about it on social media.

It will take a lot of hard work to deliver the product I promised, but I'm just the right side of out of my depth and feeling confident. With the help of the people actually involved in my work and my friends, who will discover more about it from me, I'm sure it'll work out.

I'd like to thank everyone on the periphery of my network who's shared exciting news announcements with the world on social for nudging me towards this happy equilibrium.

Of course, if we've had any level of emotional connection over the years then I'm always glad to hear your news. . . regardless of the medium.
