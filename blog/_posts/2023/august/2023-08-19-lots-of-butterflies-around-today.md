Accompanying us in the garden today was a whole host of butter flies of different kinds. They were the perfect companion to the clearing out of the meditation hut, as items were found new homes across the property.

Some were enjoying the nectar and pollens.

Some were resting on the veg.

Some were on the sun lounger.

Whilst bravest were risking it on the path.

Many were too quick to get a photograph of, but slow enough to enable us to use our [Butterflies of Cornwall](https://www.nhbs.com/butterflies-of-cornwall-book) book.

It's got everything you'd want to know about the most common species found on the peninsula.

My favourite bit is the sightings distribution chart.

It was also nice to start to see [signs of life](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/the-kale-is-still-standing/) on the giant Kale in the platinum patio. This was an area created during the 2022 heatwave to give us a shady spot. We propped up the giant veg to better let the air, light and parent butterflies get in. . . whilst keeping the slugs at bay.

As a side benefit, we can actually get into the area again.
