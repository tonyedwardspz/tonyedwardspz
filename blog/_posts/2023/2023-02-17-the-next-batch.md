Last night I attended the Plymouth Web meetup. Hosted at [Twist](https://twistbgc.co.uk/), a board game cafe in Plymouth, the evening was the usual mix of techie chat and friendly catch-ups. After the pandemic, people are still floating back into networking. It's always lovely to see old faces passing through.

Last night had an extra special silver lining. A handful of my students came along for a natter and had an enjoyable evening meeting some of the city's developer community.

For some, it was a momentous occasion. It's not easy going to your first meetup. Not knowing who will be there, walking into a room full of strangers and striking up a conversation can feel like the most challenging thing in the world to do.

But they did it. 

And I'm really proud of them.

I'll be even prouder after the next one. The students don't know it yet, but they will be talking at it.
