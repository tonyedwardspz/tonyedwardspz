Dexter is an indoor cat. Anytime that he escapes, it's normally through the bathroom window after he's slipped past one of us.

With the prototype damp super extractor in place, ready for the coming shower, I let Dexy in to have a look at it in action for the first time.

He spent a long time craning his neck to have a look, but went no closer. He seemed unsure.

I wonder what he thinks of it. !
