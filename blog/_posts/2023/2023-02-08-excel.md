 Excel is a pain in my backside and not a tool I particularly enjoy using. The most basic of features are hidden deep in the UI and feedback is non-sensical.

After years of enjoying the use of Google's 80/20 approach to spreadsheets, Excel it an overweight behemoth. Powerful, sure. User friendly. No.

I guess this means I need to go learn more about Excel :(
