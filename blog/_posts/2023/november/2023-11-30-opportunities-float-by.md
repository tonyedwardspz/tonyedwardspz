Today is the closing date for an opportunity which is mine for the taking. It's a fun opportunity, one that comes with both tangible and intrinsic rewards.

But I'm not taking it.

Why?

That's complicated.

The opportunity represents a step back into my pre-covid work life. A work life that was really fun at the time; however, the world and I have become very different since then. We've both moved on and, in my case at least, have different goals upon which life is being rebuilt.

It was a life that indirectly led to the health problems I've experienced in recent years. It was too easy to make poor choices. Added up over the years, those tiny, poor choices caused more significant problems. I could make better choices if I stepped back into that life. Sure. However, I have very little faith that I actually will, consistently, in the moment.

It was a life filled with long days, late nights, and lots of low-quality travel. Whilst the opportunity is only part-time, the knock-on effects are full-time. If you get to bed at 3am because you got home at 1am, the 6am start the next day is too much. Perfect when an 11am alarm was the norm.

It's a job not compatible with what I value from life today.

Although I won't be stepping back in time to take up a new role, I'm delighted with my current work life.

I get to help 75 second and third-year university students make the most out of their opportunities.

I get to build a highly marketable software skill set amongst a team that excels at what they do.

I get to beat the sun up every single day and have the capacity to spend plenty of time sitting in the sunshine pondering philosophical topics.

Why would I want to layer an extra 20 hours of work each week on top of that? That was the question I didn't have an answer for.

I'm happy with how I spend my days. It was nice to be asked, but now is the time to focus on the opportunities in my hands. To avoid chasing new ones, letting them float by.

Well. . . be very selective about which ones are chased at least.
