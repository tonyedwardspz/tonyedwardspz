. . . might not be to someone else. The scheduling clashes between [HalfStack Newquay](https://halfstackconf.com/newquay) and the 2023 [Golowan festival](https://golowanfestival.org/) made that crystal clear.

Following the main conference, I had to dart across Cornwall to attend this year's Mazy Eve festivities with my partner instead of the customary pub quiz. One of our favourite moments of the celebration is the release of Penglaz and the ensuing chaos. After 20 years of doing so, chasing a dead horse around a harbour feels like a completely normal thing to do.

Showing the video below to delegates from across the globe proved it's not.

If an example this extreme can slip unnoticed under the radar, who knows what else that feels completely normal to us will conjure in the minds of others.
