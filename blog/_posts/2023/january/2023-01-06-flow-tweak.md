In a [couple of](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/low-friction-writing-flow/) [previous posts](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/updating-the-low-friction-flow/), I touched on the editing flow for this website. The flow described was setup with a future (but now abandoned) feature in mind. 

Given the previously planned site changes won’t see the light of day, Git Journal has been dropped from the writing flow. It’s a cracking app that served my needs perfectly, but those needs have changed.

With this change, when I see an issue with the copy I edit the file locally. If I’m not in front of the computer, I make a note to fix any freshly found issues later that day. Typically, changes are pushed live along with the next new post. I’ve only got so may free build minutes after all!
