Today, I've added some content from my YouTube channel as posts to this website. By adding a YouTube video id to the front matter will trigger the partial to be used, which is a embedded iframe with some niceties. I've opted for a modern browser first solution to maintaining aspect ratio, which is used inline to keep things self contained.

Now there are a few videos from the channel dotted throughout the blog feed. Good luck finding them.
