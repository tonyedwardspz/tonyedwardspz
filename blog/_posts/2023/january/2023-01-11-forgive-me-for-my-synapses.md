[Forgive Me for My Synapses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP2oVKL3ydQ) is a song by the hip-hop duo [Eyedea & Abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyedea_%26_Abilities). The lyrics of the song, written by [Eyedea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyedea), reflect on the nature of human consciousness, memory, and the relationship between the mind and the brain. The song suggests that we are the product of our individual brain's electrical impulses. Just simple biology and our minds are not fully within our control, meaning our actions and thoughts are not entirely our own, but rather a product of the electrical impulses in our brain.

It features a complex rhyme scheme, with multiple internal rhymes and multisyllabic rhymes. The lyrics are also very dense and packed with wordplay, which adds to the overall complexity of the song's structure. The rhyme scheme in this song is a good example of Eyedea's wordplay and poetry skills, which is a big part of his style. The intricate rhyme patterns and dense, evocative language of the song contribute to its powerful and thought-provoking message about the nature of human consciousness and the brain.

I am all that I think\
I'm the way that my neurons are wired

They fire ions through electrical\
Synapses fusing themselves to receiving cells\
Building a network that only gets stronger\
As I continue the thought pattern\
Implied by the process\
I make a decision on what to react to\
What I perceive based on electrical current

And I am all that I feel\
I'm a neurotransmitters' desire

These chemical messengers look for a nerve\
With the perfect receptor to fit in\
They get in and give it specific instructions\
On what to release until this chain\
Of events reaches down to the glands which\
Then produce every hormone known to\
Spread to the tissue of organs\
And make them dance

All I can do is breathe\
That's how I put out the fire

And all I can do is think\
Force my circuitry to rewire

Everything outside is already inside\
There's nothing we see that we don't\
At least partially make on our own\
In our heads so it seems like my duty\
To get in my bio-computer and\
Pry apart neurons with long-term relationships\
That tell my brain to release feel bad chemicals

One day I'll be free from the brain\
That makes me, me\
Now that I know that I'm in control\
I can cut my own puppet strings

You are all that you think\
You're the way that your neurons are linked

I bet if you don't let it get a little better\
It will get a lot worse\
All you gotta do is open up and. . .
