A lot of my lecturing colleagues are worried about Chat GPT. It, and other similar technologies, are set to have a huge impact on their mental model of how the education system should be.

It's understandable. In some cases, an assignment that should take 40 hours of effort can be solved with the tool in just 20 minutes.

Does that mean 40 hours spent doing the assignment is pointless? Not at all. The value is in the learnings along the way. Knowing how to solve the assignment is the whole purpose. But it does present a problem for academics, or at least a point to ponder.

I, on the other hand, have written a set of prompts to support students with continuing in class practical sessions at home. 

There's no way they can cheat on this module. But ChatGPT has a huge potential to help them get the best out of it.

If you don't move with technology, you get replaced by it. 

If you don't move with the times, you might get replaced by someone who did.

Now that's a point to ponder in our rapidly changing world.
