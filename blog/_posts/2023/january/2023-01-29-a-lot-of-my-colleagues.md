I think I might be about to help my students cheat ðŸ‘€

But itâ€™s a good thing.

A lot of my lecturing colleagues are really worried about #ChatGPT. It, and other similar technologies, are set to have a huge impact on their mental model of how the #education system should be.

Which is understandable. In some cases, a #University assignment that should take 40 hours of effort can be solved with the tool in just 20 minutes.

Does that mean 40 hours spent doing the assignment is pointless?

No. Not at all.

The value is in the learnings along the way. Knowing how to solve the assignment is the whole purpose. But it does present a problem for academics. Or, at the very least a point to ponder.

I, on the other hand, have written a set of prompts to support students with continuing in class practical sessions at home. A user guide has been developed. Recent assignment feedback has gone through Chat GPT so they can see output from a readers perspective.

Thereâ€™s no way they can cheat on this module as is possible with many others. But ChatGPT has a huge potential to help them get the most out of it.

If you donâ€™t move with #technology, you get replaced by it.

If you donâ€™t move with the times, you might get replaced by someone who did.

If you donâ€™t use these tools to #help your work, youâ€™re putting your self at a disadvantage.

Now thatâ€™s a point to ponder in our rapidly changing world.
