Magpies have a [distinctive call](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/magpie/). They use it to protect the neighbourhood.

On a quiet day, the can be heard from a few gardens away. The harsh chatter of their warning call pierces the peace, alerting others to something of note. Its only when [they hear two](http://www.bio.bris.ac.uk/research/behavior/Vocal_Communication/pdfs/Magpie_quorum.pdf) that the wisest of birds get worried.

Over the years, I’ve come to like this call. Whether it’s a hot sunny day or a cold solstice evening, if the call continues get gets louder. . . it often means one thing.

A cat is coming.
