So. . . 

The writing flow has a problem. GitFlow changes the tag format within a posts front matter. Instead of keeping them in a list, they're changed to an array on save 🤷‍♀️

If the tags above don’t quite look right, it’s because I have better things to do that fix them right now 🤣

I do, however, apologise for the issue.
