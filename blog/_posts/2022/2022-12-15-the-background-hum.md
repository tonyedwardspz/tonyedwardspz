The background hum of civilization is back.

The peace and serenity enjoyed as part of the covid restrictions is but a distant memory. In its place, a blanket of car noise from the surrounding village and the din of the bypass encountered as you emerge from the valley. Just one movement from the symphony of humanity that keeps nature at bay.

It feels like an age ago the animals [checked in on us](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/22/animals-roaming-streets-coronavirus-lockdown-photos). The reduction in movement encouraged nature into our urban environment, allowing them to roam without fear of being startled by people or, worse still, struck by a car.

I wonder if they too tell the tale of lockdown. That time the humans went to sleep.
