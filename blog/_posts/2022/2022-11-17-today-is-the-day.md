Finally. 

Today is the day.

I've been building up the student's trust for two months. It's taken lots of hard work, plenty of engaging presentations, long evenings of preparation, and tons of team-building activities.

Or so I thought. . . 

As soon as Rick Astleyâ€™s face appeared on screen, the wily devils performed a sneaky uno reverse!

They Rickrolled me!

The game is on. . .
