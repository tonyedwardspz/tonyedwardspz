It's been a while since I've needed to use a broadcast setup.

It reminds me of the importance of perspective.

It wasn't that long ago that this room was torn apart to take down the mounted lights, installed cameras, multiple microphones, and a backdrop so funky it'd make twitch streamers want to up their game.

But this chesty thing means I've switched today's lecture to hybrid, so as not to spread my cold around the University of Plymouth campus.

With a hastily put-together setup, we'll be running a hybrid class with me and a handful of others joining remotely. . . with the majority in groups in class. Given the software industry is often structured in this way, it seems only fair to give #university students an authentic hybrid experience.

Thankfully, today's session is all about User Story mapping and was already planned to be driven almost entirely from MIRO.

PHEW!

Please excuse the behind-the-scenes mess. Things always look a little different from an alternative perspective.
