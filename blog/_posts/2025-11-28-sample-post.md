This is a sample post created to document the full set of frontmatter fields used in blog posts.

## Frontmatter Fields

- `title:` - Required. The title of the blog post.
- `tag:` - Required. Can be a single tag or a list of tags (YAML list format).
- `image:` - Optional. Path to a featured image for the post.
- `youtube:` - Optional. YouTube video ID or full URL for embedded videos.
- `linkedin:` - Optional. LinkedIn post URL for cross-posting references.
- `reddit:` - Optional. Reddit post URL for cross-posting references.

This post serves as a reference for the complete frontmatter structure found across posts in the 2024 and 2025 folders.

Jekyll takes the post date from the filename.
