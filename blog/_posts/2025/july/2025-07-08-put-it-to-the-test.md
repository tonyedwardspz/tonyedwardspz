For the past few years I've been learning German on and off. Today the is the day my approach is to be put to the test.

Instead of spending an extortionate amount of time with apps, books, and AI tools the method has essentially been to overwhelm my brain with the language without worrying what is being said. Almost without exception, every audio book, podcast, book, TV show, song, and Formula 1 race has been purposely undecipherable. The theory. . . no German word will ever take me by surprise.

It's been a weird experience. 

Whilst I only know the very basics of the language off by heart, I can recognise and say hundreds of words without knowing what they mean. Reading basic text out loud is no problem. And, hopefully, being a host of Europe's largest software development conference in Berlin won't present too many linguistic challenges.

If all else fails, they'll be treated to a few raps to fill the time.

Whilst I might struggle to order a meal in German, I'm fully prepped to rock the karaoke stage ðŸŽ¤

Gotta have your priorities right ðŸ˜Ž
