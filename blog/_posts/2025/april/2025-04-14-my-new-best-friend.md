Meet my new best friend.

dotnet new console

Over the last week, "Building CLI Applications with .NET" has taken me from zero to hero in using #dotnet for building command line scripts. With lot's of crossover of skills in coming from the world of MAUI, the book padded out my knowledge of the broader dontnet ecosystem. 

Time well spent!

Getting up and running was a breeze, and the style of writing kept the lessons fun. Many of the APIs and tools used throughout were explained thoroughly, resulting in a deeper understanding of common namespaces I use day-to-day. In particular, the System.Net.Http explanation filled in some gaps in knowledge that I didn't even know existed!

Top points:

- AnsiConsole is pretty awesome, and will allow me to improve the visuals of scripts
- The guidance on testing will roll into my broader development flow
- The Docker section is going to help with transferring these CLI skills into my home server setup
- Breaking up apps into something modular was explained in a way that made it clear WHY you should choose to do this (and when not to)

I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who's looking to improve their coding skills and has an interest in building CLI apps.

But I'm left with a problem. One that not even Tidjani Belmansour can help with. . .

I want to migrate my existing script library from Ruby/Python/JS into .NET!

Thankfully, I now have the skills and tools at my fingertips ðŸ’»

Take a look at the book yourself ðŸ‘‡
