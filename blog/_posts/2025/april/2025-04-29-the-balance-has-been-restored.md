‚öñÔ∏è Balance has been restored.

We're even now University of Plymouth.

It's been a blast encouraging the next generation of software geekies out into the world for the past three years. In fact, it's been the most fun I've had professionally as part of a "proper job", and I'm pretty sure I've learned more than my students!

They've been the perfect counter weight to the three years of education the institution gave me in years gone by. Over my time as a student, I morphed from an introverted web dev afraid of his own code editor into a record breaking student who travels the world to chat code, shake hands, and spit hot bars.

To say this place changes lives is an understatement.

To think I've been a part of that for others is slightly overwhelming.

I'll always be grateful to Shirley for the initial opportunity to return, and to JJ for the mentoring and support ever since. And massive apologies to Rory for all the last minute marking moderation. . . just one left ü§£

But all good things come to an end. 

Whilst I'm sure to pop up occasionally as part of future students studies, it's time to entwine everything learned during both stints plus the time between into an internal team.

Which one?
