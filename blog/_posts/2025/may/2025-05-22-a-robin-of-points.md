Four days. Three meetups. Two talks. One Robins worth of points.

Only a couple days left to fix it.

The first leg of the 2025 business bumble is complete. After reaching escape velocity from Cornwall, I've touched down in Manchester and Leeds so far. They're both lovely cities, and as the first time in the region I already can't wait to come back. The location and friendly people weren't the problem.

Nor was the Dot Net North meetup. The folks there were welcoming and played their part in the talk. Amongst all the people that have donned the protective equipment, some how Aiden seemed the most comfortable. Is it time for him to pack up the keyboard, give up the meetup life, and start a new career as a children's entertainer?

The amazing folks at Leeds JS wasn't my issue either. In fact they were the pick me up between problems. Together we pitted the browser SpeechRecognitionAPI against Whisper to find the true transcription champion. I'm not sure we came to a decisive conclusion, but one edged the other in this battle of the ages. The group seemed happy about it judging by the photo!

The Leeds Sharp community are far from a problem, but this is where it emerged. Trying out a few new bits for the #MidiBirds talk, the group offered the perfect feedback mechanism. Drop this bit, shape this bit, cry about that bit. Tons of great comments during and after the meet. When dressed up, John's resignation to the reality of the situation was inverse of Aiden comfort.

And it was after when the problem emerged.

Picture the scene. We're sat in a bar. The group are in wigs. I've got my sparkly game show jacket on. Then it hit.

Team Null!

There shouldn't be a team null!

You certainly shouldn't be able to win a Robins worth of points from the spin!

We were trying Wheel of Fortune, the latest game to be added into the talks #dotnetMAUI games app. It is seriously broken.

Shoehorning a three player game into a two player setup wasn't such a good idea it seems.

So now the race is on.

- Will I be able to fix this ahead of Techorama next week? 
- What 15 mins of the session will get dropped? 
- Is a Robins worth of points worth more or less than the top answer in Family Fortunes?

Big problems, I'm sure you'll agree.

Thankfully, theres a coding lodge en-suite to my London bolthole. You'll find me hunkered down here for the next few days.
