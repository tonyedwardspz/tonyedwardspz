How does one celebrate the final few days of a business trip?

Well. . . I got attacked üôÄ

The last leg of the summer business bumble saw me return to the North of England, taking in the sights of Sheffield, Nottingham, and York. Whilst each city had their charms, and brought something different to events within them, it was York that will leave a lasting impression.

The first night saw me pop to Nottingham to take in the [.NET Notts meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/). The subject for the evening was MongoDB and how to effectively incorporate it into a .NET app. I was super happy to find out that EF works nicely with it, blending platforms tooling with document based storage flawlessly. In hindsight, I shouldn't have skipped this one after only 2 hours sleep.

The next night I spoke at the [.NET Sheffield meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetsheff/), sharing the tale of the flock and the games that resulted from my bird catching hobby. The talk went well it seemed, with lots of positive comments and the typical "more code" request. For this outing, I focused on an updated story arc, shortening the non-code section, ahead of an upcoming rejig of the talk. It felt like the story still came across.

Next up was attending the [ACCU York meetup](https://www.meetup.com/accu-york/) in the patch office. This was a really useful event, with the focus of the group being to deepen knowledge of software development. The topic for the night was Code reviews, with Graham sharing lot's of useful tidbits. One in particular was the playing card framework for feedback during them, which was super useful and will be introduced to the team back at work.

For the final night, I spoke at the [.NET York meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetyork/). As the last talk of the tour, the session was at the forefront of my mind and I could focus my efforts more on the delivery style. In this regard, I wish this outing was how well it went at the conference the week before. . . but we learn ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

York was also the last time I'll probably see Kevin after tracking him across all four of these events. I'm not sure what he did in a previous life to deserve two nights as a clown and one night as Bruce Forsythe. . . but it must've been bad! I promise I wasn't actually stalking you Kevin! üòá

York, however, got it's revenge on his behalf. I guess it was Karma trying to rebalance the universe.

I was attacked by a Goose.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to record the sound of the attack for a future iteration of the Midi Birds talk, but did get the offender on camera before they pounced. The noise is seared into my brain, alongside the lesson to be learned:

Don't stroke Geese.
