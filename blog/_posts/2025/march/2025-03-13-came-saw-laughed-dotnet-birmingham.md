We came. We laughed. We threw things at Bruce Forsyth.  
  
It was your typical .NET Birmingham meetup. . . right?  
  
Huge thank you to everyone who came out last night and joined in the fun. You achieved that fabled state of awesomness, just like I knew you would. . . even though you seemed unsure at the outset ðŸ¤£ You made me feel super welcome, and the conversations that followed the meet were interesting, inspiring, and full of things to check out afterwards. Fab!  
  
Massive thank you to Ryan for being our sacrificial Bruce for the night, with the group intermittently throw things at him during the talk. Evan (my surprise co-writer) particularly relished the opportunity. I've not seen eyes light up like that for quite some time! Well. . . until Pete had his turn ðŸŽ¯  
  
David, Dave, Sam, and Adam were the perfect contestants. Sam had the best run ever for "Play your birds right" across all outings so far, which meant the audience didn't have to shout out that much at all!  
  
They didn't seem to mind that much though.  
  
Thanks for making this happen Dave, and to BJSS for accommodating us. This is a great meetup that's managed to keep it's charm in the post-covid era. It's clear the community that's built up around it are both passionate about what they do, and in supporting the group.  
  
They're on the look out for speakers for the coming months. If you're doing something interesting with dotnet and want to share it with the world, this is the place to do it!
