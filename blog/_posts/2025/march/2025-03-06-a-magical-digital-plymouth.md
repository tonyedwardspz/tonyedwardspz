üÉè All bets were fulfilled at tonights Digital Plymouth.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I can officially hang up the Wizard hat now.

As expected, the meetup was a treat, with a great mix of talks and conversation going on well into the evening.

Charlotte Ashcroft-Booth and Adela Hawley gave a really engaging overview of the Promare project. It was especially nice to hear that our day to day tech can be used in such an important space, preserving our collective marine heritage digitally. Tons of jump of points to dive deeper, and a marine heritage centre in Devonport to explore that I've never heard of!

Frazer shared the insights from a recent report from the Acronyms team. The points around focusing on incremental improvements when incorporating tech into traditional businesses were salient. And made sense. An agile approach works well for software businesses, and it makes sense that the same mindset would help companies across the board. Something to ponder here ü§î

My talk went down well with the audience, and served its purpose personally.

As a seasoned speaker, its not often I get to feel uncomfortable on stage. This talk was designed from the ground up to create a situation where I do, whilst introducing a room of developers and product peeps to the joy that is .NET MAUI.

And trust me. . . a nylon Wizard outfit in a hot room is certainly uncomfortable!

The jokes were cringeworthy judging by the groans. . . but you have [Rendle's advice](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/bristol-and-birmingham-dotnet-fun/) to blame for that. Not me. Whilst it fell short of being stand up, incorporating properly structured jokes was a challenge to write and deliver, allowing me to stretch my speaking skills in a new direction.

Thankfully, after the recent Tech Cornwall Event and this Digital Plymouth gathering, the magical hat has had its last outing. 

I can't say I'm sad about it! 

You've seen me in Full Wizard mode. . . but check out the comments in the LinkedIn post to find out who managed to achieve a partial wizard state on the night.
