WTF was that #WTS!?!

To call What the Stack a conference would be doing it a disservice. 

Community conference comes closer. But still not quite right. Even amongst the best grassroots tech events in Europe(ish) , this one stood out amongst them all. And not just for the conference itself.

Skopje offered the perfect location for a late summer tech event. Clear blue skies provided the backdrop for a architecturally interesting city. Vienna-esque grandeur blended with Soviet style buildings to offer one of the most interesting walks to an event venue ever, with the venue itself offering a peek inside a great example of the brutalist style.

But 30+ speakers didn't descend on Macedonia from around the globe to take in the buildings, weather, and the THOUSANDS of statues. We were there to share our love of the web through our talks.

We certainly did that!

The speakers brought their A++ game, and despite the demo-gods not being on the side of everyone, the sessions were clearly a hit with audience. Whether you wanted to deep dive into React, Angular, (software) architecture, hear case studies, or be made to think, there was something for everyone. Whilst I didn't get to see a whole host of the sessions, one  of the ones I did really shone a light on how useful Supabase would be in prototyping software. Thanks Fanis!

Once the audience had filtered away after the event, the awesomeness of the gathering really shone through. After comparing notes amongst the speaker group, the consensus is that attendees were proactive in seeking out speakers to talk to. Whilst this might not sound like much, typically you'd get a couple of "thanks, that was great" comments and maybe a question or two. 

Not at What the Stack.

The community were keen to talk. Very keen in fact. And this is a great sign of a thriving, safe, and engaged community that you don't get at many events, and one of the things a community conferences should be. Rough around the edges, but polished in the places that matter. Informal, but without becoming a collection of cliques. Honest to what it is, whilst trying to grow into something greater.

Overall, this has been my favorite conference in a very long time, with Skopje rocketing to the top of my favorite cities. If you are a speaker in the web world, follow the conf page and keep an eye out for next years CFP.

If you ask nicely, Farris might buy you a post-event ice cream as well üôè

Hope to see you there in 2026!
