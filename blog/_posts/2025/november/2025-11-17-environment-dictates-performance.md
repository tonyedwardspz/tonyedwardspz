A recent conversation with a mentee reminded me of this well known phrase. It's one that makes logical sense. 

If you're in a high performing environment, your much more likely to perform to a high level.

If you're in a creative environment, you're much more likely to be creative.

If you're surrounded by people who are learning, incrementing skills upwards, and pushing boundaries. . . you will as well.

The world around us is a normalising factor.

My advice to them at the outset of their career. . . be eternally careful about the world you choose to inhabit.
