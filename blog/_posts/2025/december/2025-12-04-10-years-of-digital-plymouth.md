10 year of bringing Plymouth's digital community together!

Getting to come along for the journey has been an honor.

We're too quick to say that something is life changing nowadays. So much so that its become a cliché. But for this meetup, the people around it, and those that attend, it is often true in the truest sense of the word.

Whenever I'm doing something amazingly fun professionally, in the farthest corners of Europe, I can ALWAYS trace the origin back to the encouragement and support that came from being a part of the Digital Plymouth / Plymouth Web / PlymouthJS communities 🙏 

It been great to watch it grow over the past decade into something bigger, more diverse, and even more impactful to the city.

Here's to 10 more years of the same 🥂
