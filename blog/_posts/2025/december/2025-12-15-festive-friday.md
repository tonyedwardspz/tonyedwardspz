34 people, 23 dishes, (only) 4 bottles of Prosecco, and 1 happy chef *.

That's a festive Friday at Sapphire House.

To bring the team together before we start disappearing ahead of Christmas, the Sapphire Holidays IT team, joined up with parts of the Aspects Holidays and Classic Cottages teams to craft the ultimate office roast. Of course, this came shortly after giving out the presents.

The meal itself was both a success and tasty!

Honey glazed parsnips met crispy roast potatoes. Succulent beef collided with terrific turkey. Cute little piggies nestled in their blankets, with a trio of gravies smothering them all. It's was one of those moments that having multiple full kitchens in the building became a major highlight of office life.

Unfortunately, expectations for 2026 are now super high. 

I suspect we'll only top 2025 by getting a visit from Santa himself. . . although Dan was a adequate stand-in come time for secret Santa.

* Ok. There were actually two chefs. . . but only one of them regularly makes me bacon sandwiches so he's getting all the credit
