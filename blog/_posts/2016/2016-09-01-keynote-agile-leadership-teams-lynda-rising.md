<span style="font-weight: 400;">Linda surveys the audience to see who uses Agile. Unsurprisingly we all do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">None of us used science to come to this decision. We used gut instinct and friends opinions. If you want to convince someone of something, tell a story. Science is not convincing. Using both at the same time you can achieve a much more convincing argument.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you need evidence for something that’s common sense?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is medicine science. Leeches were used for hundreds of years. In some cases this even caused deaths. Even scientists were not convinced that the evidence was true. This was due to the generations of stories told in the communities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Linda tells the story of semmelweis trying to convince his peers tha washing hands when moving between autopsies and births was a good thing. Logical arguments did not work for him. He died in an insane asylum and had a pauper&#8217;s burial.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Could agile be a placebo? It has no scientific evidence. It has high priests. It works, and when it doesn&#8217;t it because you don’t believe in it!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists, and the rest of us, suffer from a huge range of biases. Even knowing who is taking the real drugs can cause the scientists to affect the outcome, hence the move to ‘double-blind” studies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Education is an old model, where one person speaks and the rest listen. That’s the issue with stories. We listen, repeat and take it as gospel. But this in not how we get better.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we use science in Agile. Laurie Williams used science to demonstrate the benefits of Pair programming (Pair programming illuminated). Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman is highly recommended.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Dawkins expressed that you don&#8217;t need to do science in order to benefit from it. Just knowing the principles of the scientific process can help you to improve the cognitive process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one ever won a Nobel Prize for checking email. Enjoy lunch together and share ideas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile is a trial…. And experiment…. A learning process. Return to the mindset of a learner.</span>
