I popped my head into Tumblr recently and found [a bunch of posts I’d written in the past](https://www.tumblr.com/tonyedwardspz).

They were writen for a University module I took “back in the day” where the objective was to build a browser based game using the Phaser framework. I created a platform game called [Smoothie Hunter](https://github.com/tonyedwardspz/Smoothie-Hunter), where the player explored the undiscovered jungle in search of new smoothie ingredients. 

Being honest, the game was functionally polished rather than being fun to play, but it did tick a whole load of boxes and I received a solid grade. The experience didn’t light my fire for games development, but going through the process of designing and building a game did make me a better software engineer.

One day I’m likely to move the posts to this site for posterity. For now, I’m content with simply rediscovering some lost writing and having a pleasant trip down memory lane.
