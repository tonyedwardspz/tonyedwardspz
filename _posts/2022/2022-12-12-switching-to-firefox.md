At this moment in time, my third switch to the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) web browser is underway. Recent changes in both the organisations focus and browser development are once again making it a compelling choice of window into the web.

The first switch came during the noughties [browser wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_Browser_War_(2004%E2%80%932017)). Internet Explorer had a strangle hold on the market, brought about by its inclusion as the default choice within windows. At the time, Firefox felt like a breath of fresh air, and its open source nature and heritage gave many of us inhabiting the web confidence. It also scored really well on the [acid test](https://www.acidtests.org/), which was similarly reassuring to my fellow web masters.

This stuck until Chrome started making waves. The promise of a fast and stable browser with an accompanying open source engine was welcomed. 

The second admittedly half hearted switch came during uni in the mid 20-teens. With more time spent developing front ends, the browser tools were handy when cross-browser testing. It didn't stick, but stayed installed and fired up occasionally for a touch of testing. 

The third, but undoubtedly not final, switch is underway. It's been a gradual move over, starting on mobile as an effort to increase privacy. As a consequence, ads are reduced and speed is increased. The uptick in travel corresponds with a decrease in connectivity whilst moving through a rural area. There's only so much JS a shaky 3g connection can handle.

The ad blocker is a staple of the modern web for anyone in the know. Moves by Apple, similarly large companies an even [governments](https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/07/luck-of-the-irish/#schrems-revenge) are shining an increasingly bright spotlight on user data and the privacy of it. The result is a gradual restriction on the privacy invasive methods. As a user,itâ€™s just nice to have the relatively ad free experience available via my mobile phone. The privacy benefits simply come along with it.

After a month of using Firefox as a daily browser, I absent mindedly opened Chrome to browse some F1 news. The adverts were almost overwhelming, and I quickly became convinced that the choice to switch was the right one.
