There are 34 people in this waiting room.

Everyone, including myself, is staring at a screen.

I bet this train station waiting room would have been filled with conversation in years gone by. A hubbub of excitement ahead of the collective travels. 

Today, there is an air of resignation.

Sure, screens are just the latest thing used to isolate an individual from the world around them whilst travelling. Books, newspapers, and Walkmans have all served the same purpose.

Somehow, a haunched figure clutching a mobile phone just feels different. At least with a newspaper you could read the front page opposite you.
