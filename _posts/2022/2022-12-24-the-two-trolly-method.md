We cracked it. Finally. Two trolly shopping is the way forward folks. Its so astoundingly simple, the only surprise is that it's not been realised sooner.

My partner can meander through the fresh isles, at leisure, with her own trolly. Studiously scanning the choices and choosing the most sensible selection based on a list of criteria known only to herself.

I can nip around and get all of the day to day items, knocking them off the shopping list. Sure, the shopping is dotted around a much wider area, and requires more travel.  .  . but the mini mission is far more fun.

Two trolleys. It's the way forwards folks. You read it here first.
