Curating extra time in the morning is a wise thing to do. A mantra adopted whilst working 13 hour days in retail was:

> “A minute in the morning is worth 5 in the afternoon”

Getting behind by even a few minutes in the morning can have knock on effects for the remainder of the day. Perhaps it causes a rush for the train. Maybe you don’t get to make lunch. Worst of all, you might not even get to play with the cat before heading out of the door.

To curate time, the evening before an early morning start, I often do some combination of: 

- Get clothes ready
- Pack a bag
- Prepare lunch
- Prep for any early meetings

Adulting ftw
