    - 500 days of lockdown

---

During the 500 days of lockdown, one of the many DIY tasks undertaken was to repair a section of crumbling granite wall. For bonus points, adding in a handful of steps was a requested addition.

It was a throw away comment from my Girlfriend the evening prior that started things off. "It would be so much easier to do x and y if we could move from the front garden to the back garden without going through the house".

This was like a red rag to a bull. Engineers at heart want to optimise everything in any which way possible. I certainly enjoy recouping minutes incrementally. Doing so via a Herculean physical task such as this supports my belief that a good stint in the garden counts as exercise. This was set to be a full body garden workout

Starting at 7am, the resources needed from around the property were gathered together. Shovels. Wheelbarrow. Wire brush. A few bags of cement.

After all, the most eco purchase is the one you never need to make.

The morning saw the existing wall torn down to what was solid whilst the day warmed up to become one of the hottest that year. Within the stretch of wall, a gap was introduced for the small flight of steps. The reclaimed granite chunks were brushed over to remove the last of the baked mud that has been holding the wall together for the past 60 plus years. The 5 metre stretch was ready and prepped for the next phase by lunch time, which is when I first caught myself moaning about the days heat.

Sitting in the shade with a corned beef and lettuce sandwich, I stated thinking about how the temperature was affecting the job at hand. “Sure, I’m hot. . . but there are other people in the world doing this kind of labour intensive work in hotter conditions. Why am I grumbling?”

Pondering the heat some more, the obvious conclusion was drawn. Putting on a jumper is the logical move.

Now. At first glance you might think this was a stupid idea. The heat stroke I gave myself would tend to support that conclusion. Unfortunately, I didn’t know what heat stoke was nor how serious it is for another 18 months. Instead of pure stupidity, it was intended to be an act of voluntary discomfort.

It was very uncomfortable.

Come the end of the day, the wall had been rebuilt to a better standard than at the outset but still in keeping with our rustic crumbling aesthetic. A spot of pointing and a cleanup of overflow muck from the granite faces over the following few afternoons saw the project completed. 

The small set of stairs now allows us to nip between the front and back gardens with ease. No more clambering up and down the Rockery with a lawnmower slung awkwardly over the shoulder. Hooray.
