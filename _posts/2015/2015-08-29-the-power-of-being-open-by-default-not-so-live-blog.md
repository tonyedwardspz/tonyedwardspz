For most of human history the act of creation has been an isolated task for the intellectual elite. The barriers of entry to creation was high, bearing mind that people were generally not literate.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that only the final work was ever distributed. The web has changed this in a short time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The web is 25. The creators, when reflecting on the history of the web came up with four reasons to explain its success.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubiquity</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Royalty free</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralised</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Built on open standards and collaboration</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the web has evolved so have the tools, many of which fill the above criteria which facilitates collaboration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Git has revolutionised the open source world, through its encouragement of clear licences. Brad uses the CSS-Tricks licence as an example of the mentality of the web. It’s open by default.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers are the first to stay up late to publish their thoughts and idea with the web being the perfect medium.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He talks about a friend who works at a cancer research facility. By increasing the size of the font on the donation form they received 20% more donations. They were not however allowed to share this fact as it would destroy their competitive advantage.</span>

**Competitive advantage!!!!**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad and his wife have donated their time to a local food bank to improve their site. Everything, even the contract was openly shared.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s uncomfortable to share work before it finished. It forces articulation of ideas and uses the community to improve the project. The greatest benefit is that others have helped to improve the site. As a consequence like minded people have gravitated together.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This hub served as a blueprint that could be used to help other.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Data exhaust is the byproduct of a life online and its this data that makes companies rich (FaceBook). Brad suggests that a creative exhaust can be more beneficial to the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad found out that this project became mandatory reading for a former lecturers web design course.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By sharing we get great feedback. Without sharing we get none.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not about what you do, it’s about what you enable other people to do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whats better. Increasing donations on your own site by 20% or increasing donations to every non profit by 20%.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The web is an amazing tool to that facilitates the things that society needs to flourish. To do so Brad gives three pieces of advice.</span>
