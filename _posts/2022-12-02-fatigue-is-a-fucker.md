Over the last few months I’ve had [two heart “events”](https://tonyedwardspz.co.uk/blog/i-beat-the-sun-up/). The doctor in A&E called them attacks, but telling someone I’ve had a heart attack leaves an impression that’s removed from reality. But that’s what they were, with the most recent being less than 20 days ago from the time of writing.

The day-to-day effect is that I’m perpetually fatigued, and have been since mid September.

Everything takes it out of me at the moment.

Walking, showering, delivering talks, getting to the office, early mornings. They’re all exhausting.

Hell. Even the medication I’ve been on since attack number one sucks. It’s caused my kidneys to show the early signs of failure. Whilst this was expected and monitored, they’re still not running at 100%.

None of this would be an issue, and I probably would have recovered fully by now, if I’d had a chance to rest. Both of my new jobs have started since the first attack. I got out of hospital on a Friday and started one of them the next Monday. The combination of immense amounts of travel, early mornings and a lack of decent rest have prevented a proper recovery.

Add in the fact that a gradual and unnoticed change in eyesight is leaving me with constant headaches / migraines, you can see why it’s been a rough few months (even if I can't 🧐).

But. . . 

I should be getting some glasses in the next few weeks. .  . assuming poor eyesight is the reason for my headaches.

A switch in medication means my kidneys (and liver to a lesser extent) are able to start to recover. Hopefully.

The pains in my chest are increasingly few and far between.

I’m still fatigued as fuck tho.

Three outta four ain’t bad though. . . right?
