Hulk Hogan is a key part of my computing lectures.

Do you feel me brother (or sister)?

A cheeky GIF in the middle of an information-dense slide deck can:

- break up the session
- get a little chuckle
- add some much-needed spandex to proceedings

The Hulkster probably isn't your go-to presentation GIF. But that's ok. I won't judge you :)
