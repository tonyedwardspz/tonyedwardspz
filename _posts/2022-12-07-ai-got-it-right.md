It's easy for #AI to get things wrong.

Don't worry. . . I'm not going to start talking about training sets, GANS, and biases in datasets.

Why?

Because there's no need. NightCafe Studio got it spot-on here.

I often use AI-generated imagery in my lecture slides to completely avoid issues attribution within strict #university referencing guidelines. Giving a phrase and the platform used is enough in this instance.

For today's session, I needed a picture representing "A team of game developers".

This is not the team of hooded male teenagers I was hesitantly expecting!
