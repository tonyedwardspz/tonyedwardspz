Anecdotally, the amount of people who say thanks after having the door held open for them has fallen.

I'm not sure why, or even if it's worth noting. But it has been noted.

I'm not sure if it says something about the direction western society is heading or not. But it possibly might.

I am sure I'll keep holding the door open for people. The same goes for saying thanks to anyone who does the same for me. 

I'll even thank myself if someone else doesn't. Karma will take care of the rest.
