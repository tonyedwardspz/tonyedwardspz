Podcasts are the hot thing in broadcasting at the moment, saving millions of people&#8217;s sanity during the daily commute. In recent months I&#8217;ve become a bit of a podcast hoover, listening to episode after episode during my commute and work time. Here&#8217;s 12 of my favourite shows covering the technical, the businessy and the geeky.
