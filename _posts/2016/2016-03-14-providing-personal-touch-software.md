It’s fair to say that software will help shape all areas of our lives in the coming years. Whilst the benefits of automating repetitive tasks and providing useful and contextual information are self-explanatory, there is one area that software is greatly under utilised: the personal touch.

The benefits of providing a user with even a minimal amount of personalisation, especially with [regards to the internet](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/dbm/journal/v9/n2/abs/3240069a.html "Personalisation of the web"), are well-known. You would be hard pressed to find a webpage with a login that does not include some level of personalisation. Twitter, for example, shows the current user’s name and photo on every screen to help identify the account as theirs. Settings can further personalise an application, but how does this translate into the real world?
