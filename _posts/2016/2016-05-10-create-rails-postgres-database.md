In the excitement of scaffolding a rails project, more often than not I forget to create the database, resulting in a moment or two of confusion. Thankfully, if you have CreateDB installed its as simple as entering one command into a terminal prompt.


    createdb your_database_name


CreateDB can also do some other amazing stuff, but thanks to the rails way of doing things you will only use them occasionally. Check out this [Tutorials Point](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm "tutorials point") article for overview of everything CreateDB that you might wish to know.

Hopefully this will now stick 🙂
