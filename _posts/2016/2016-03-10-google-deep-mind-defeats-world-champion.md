Yesterday, Google’s Deepmind Artificial Intelligence machine defeated the world’s top ranked Go player in the second round of a five match showdown. Lee Sedol, who had been predicting he would win 5-0, must win the final three games in order to win the $1 million prize.

Computers have long been able to defeat champions in games such as Chess, Checkers and Jeopardy. This victory acts as another signpost in the journey to an AI-assisted future. Unlike Chess, Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win due to the number of possibilities, making traditional AI methods such as Brute Force more difficult.

Google Deepmind is a British artificial intelligence company founded in 2010 which was acquired by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Wikipedia Article") in 2014. The company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a similar fashion to humans, resulting in a computer that appears to mimic the short-term memory of the human brain. Whilst the neural network’s capabilities are impressive, it is the latest in a recent spate of AI assisted technologies to make waves.
