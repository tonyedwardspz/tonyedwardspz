[Caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/ "Web Api Browser Compatibility") is an invaluable resource for checking out browser compatibility for many CSS and JavaScript API&#8217;s. I recently sat down to decide the front end stack, and more specifically the basis of the layout system, for a long-lived project. I flashed back to [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons)&#8216; [Enhance Conf](http://enhanceconf.com/) talk, &#8216;[Progressing our Layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZPPwxumEzs)&#8216; where Jen demonstrated how to integrate Google Analytics and Can I Use. She reminded us that it doesn&#8217;t matter if the whole planet can use a feature, only if your users can.

## Caniuse and Google Analytics

Open up Caniuse and click on settings from the search bar.

![Caniuse settings](/assets/images/import/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-16-at-14.15.32.png){:loading="lazy"}

This opens the settings fly out. From there, find and click the button under the heading &#8216;From Google Analytics&#8217;.

Once the authentication completes you&#8217;ll be returned to the original page. This time you&#8217;re seeing the device compatibility of  your actual users.

How do you handle feature detection in your app or front end? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonyedwardspz).
